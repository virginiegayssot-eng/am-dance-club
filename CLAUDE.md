## Wide content on mobile

Never wrap a `<table>` (or any content that can exceed the viewport width — wide flex rows, long unbroken text) in a container that only has `overflow-hidden`. That clips anything past the edge with no way to scroll to it — the content silently becomes inaccessible on mobile instead of erroring.

If the outer wrapper needs `overflow-hidden` to clip rounded corners (the `card` class), nest the scrollable content in its own `overflow-x-auto` div:

```tsx
<div className="card overflow-hidden">
  <div className="overflow-x-auto">
    <table className="w-full text-sm font-body">
      ...
    </table>
  </div>
</div>
```

Check this whenever adding a new `<table>` or wide row of content — test it at a narrow (375px) viewport width before considering it done.
